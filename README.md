# Hands-on-spring

The goal behind making this repo is to learn and practise the fundamentals of spring. I will try to put some key points for every topic which can be used to quick notes.

The topic I will be covering in this are:
1. Spring security - basic
2. Spring security - oAuth2
3. Spring security - JWT
